# When a plotter tries to find a variable in the input dataframe, it may not
# be able to find an exact string match between the user-given variable name
# and the column name. 
#
# To make it easier for the user to specify which variables they want, 
# the plotter will reference this yml file to look for alternative names for 
# the variable when an identical match cannot be found.
